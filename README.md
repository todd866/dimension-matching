# Simulated Geometry

**Why Information Alone Cannot Be Alive**

## Overview

Life instantiates geometry; AI simulates geometry using information.

*Information* is what can be copied without loss—Shannon entropy, bits, facts. *Geometry* is the constrained manifold within which a system operates—the dimensionality of knowing, not the quantity of known. Current AI has vast information but minimal self-maintained geometry.

## Key Results

- **Information vs Geometry**: Precise distinction with measurable consequences
- **Match error ε**: Agreement among complexity estimators as signature of genuine geometry
- **Biology as existence proof**: Cross-scale coherence, dormancy as geometry-without-dynamics
- **Why AI simulates**: No intrinsic oscillations, no viability coupling, vertically flat

## Paper

- **Title**: Simulated Geometry: Why Information Alone Cannot Be Alive
- **Target**: BioSystems (hypothesis paper)
- **Status**: In preparation
